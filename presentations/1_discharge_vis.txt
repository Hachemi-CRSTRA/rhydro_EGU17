discharge visualization

Dataset from <http://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/meanflow/39072>

1. Read in the dataset <https://github.com/brry/rhydro/blob/master/data/discharge.csv>
2. Visualize the entire time series
3. Create a movie with the package `animation` that shows one year per frame and moves day by day.
You can use `berryFunctions::monthAxis(ym=TRUE)` for nice axis labeling.
