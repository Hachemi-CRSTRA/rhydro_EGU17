# Using R in Hydrology - EGU2017 Short Course

**(Co-)Conveners and Instructors**: Berry Boessenkool (C, I), Shaun Harrigan (Co-C), Katie Smith (Co-C), and Daniel Klotz (I) 
**Contact**: Berry Boessenkool, Potsdam University (Germany), <berry-b@gmx.de>

You are invited to post and discuss questions in the 
[Hydrology in R Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1130214777123909/).

## Details 
- **Where?**  Monday, 24 April, 15:30â€“17:00  / Room -2.31  (*basement!*); 
- **Course Description**: http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2018/session/28914

## Topics
This course is directed primarily at hydrologists interested in using R for their research.
You will get (a) an impression of how powerful R is as a tool and (b) all the code to get started yourself.
The following topics are covered:

* Good coding practice, report generation (Rstudio, `rmarkdown`, R notebook)
* Using R as GIS (reading a rainfall shapefile + Kriging, `sf` + `leaflet` + `mapview` + `OSMscale`)
* River discharge time-series visualisation and extreme value statistics (`animation` + `extremeStat`)
* Hydrological modelling with `airGR`
* Trend Analysis in R (`trend` + `hydroTSM`)


## Slides
You can `rightclick - Save as` the 
[html notebook with R output](https://github.com/brry/rhydro/raw/master/presentations/rhydro.nb.html)
and then open the html document in a regular browser.  
For smartphones, you can try the [pdf](https://github.com/brry/rhydro/raw/master/presentations/rhydro.pdf)
(without the interactive graphs).

To get all the material including the datasets and presentation source code, we recommend to
[download the whole github course repository](https://github.com/brry/rhydro/archive/master.zip).



## Checks
You can check if your laptop is prepared for the course by running the
[checkpc](https://github.com/brry/rhydro/blob/master/checkpc.R) script in your R console:
```R
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brry/rhydro/master/checkpc.R")
```
This will give instructions if packages are missing / outdated.
