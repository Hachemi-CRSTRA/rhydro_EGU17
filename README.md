### check
You can check if your laptop is prepared for the course by running
[checkpc](https://github.com/brry/rhydro/blob/master/checkpc.R):
```R
source("http://raw.githubusercontent.com/brry/rhydro/master/checkpc.R")

This will give you a confirmation message if everything is fine and give instructions otherwise.
